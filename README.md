# Idea
Mahatati is a system composed of an iOS application and a fuel pump electronic circuit. The system was designed to provide safe and fast payment for customers. It allows customers to use the application to pay for the needed petrol. The application later will generate a QR code which will be scanned by the scanner that is being attached to our designed fuel pump where the fuel or petroleum meter in the fuel pump will be accordingly adjusted based on the information recorded in the QR. In pursuit of Vision 2030 in building smart cities, we hope that our system will be a starting point in building smart gas stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
